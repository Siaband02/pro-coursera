# How to use the site
Run the index.html file in any modern browser.
You will see a page with an authorisation form, in which you need to enter your login and password.
If you are not yet registered, the page also has a "Register" button, which will take you to a new user registration form.
Once you have successfully logged in, you will be redirected to a welcome page.

# How the site works
The site works on the following principle:
When a user submits a login or registration form, JavaScript collects data from the form fields and sends it to the server.
The server checks that the data is correct and returns the response to the client.
If the data is correct, the client is redirected to the welcome page. Otherwise, an error message is displayed to the client.
